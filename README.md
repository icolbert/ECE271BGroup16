# Evaluating Handwritten Math Expressions from Images using Neural Networks
## ECE 271B: Statisticall Learning II

We train various neural network architectures on the MNIST and HASY dataset and use image processing to read in handwritten mathetamical equations and expressions.

The project is broken up into 3 parts:
* Train an MLP to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset and specific characters from the HASY database
* Extend the network to identify characaters and digits from images containing handwritten equations
* Evaluate mathematical expressions from the network classifications
